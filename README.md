# Finance

## NPV

Handles irregular cash flows well.

## Two IRRs

Since the cash flow pattern for the 83(b) election is negative -> positive -> negative , I get multiple IRRs (a negative and a very large positive). This is meaningless and unusable.

# Software

## python version

`3.7.16` to accommodate numpy-financial (NPV)
